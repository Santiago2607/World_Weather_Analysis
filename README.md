# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

During this project, we were able to assist PLANMYTRIP, a top travel technology company, with the help of the head of its analysis department, Jack, to collect and present data for travelers via a search page so they can select the best time of the year to plan their vacation, as well as book some nice hotels around the area they want to visit. 

Some of the resources we constantly used to accomplish this task were OpenWeatherMap API, Google Places API, JSON, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Python. In addition, after a deep understanding and coding of the analysis of the data we are able to show you the final results divided into the three most important parts of the project. 

## Weather_Database

During this first part of the project, we collected information such as latitude, longitude, max temp, humidity, cloudiness, wind, country, and current weather description of over more than 500 cities so people can have a great variety of places from where to choose depending on their own preferred travel criteria. We also created a set of latitude and longitude combinations so people can see the closest availability of hotels around the area. 

Below is a figure of an example of the information we gather from all the datasets.

## Vacation_Search

In this part of the analysis, we were able to combined the information from the Weather_Database along with the Google Maps API so we can get a map showing all the options of hotels people have depending on the area and weather preferences.

## Vacation_Itinerary

For the third part of this project, we combined the information from the last two parts of the analysis so we could create an itinerary based on them. For this example, we created a vacation itinerary that starts from Scituate, US, then visits Yarmouth, Westport, Union, and ends back in Scituate. 

For this first picture below, we can see the graphic representation of the itinerary route.

For this second picture below, we can see the best hotel options according to the cities and weather preferences people want.

## Extra Files

To finish this analysis, we created a group of images inside the weather_data folder in this repository that show the different correlations between latitude and the weather description travelers usually take into consideration before travel.
